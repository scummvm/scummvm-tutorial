In this new version of ScummVM Android, significant changes were made to the file access system to allow support for modern versions of the Android Operating System.

If you find that your existing added games or custom paths no longer work, please edit those paths and this time use the SAF system to browse to the desired locations.

To do that:

1. For each game whose data is not found, go to the "Paths" tab in the "Game Options" and change the "Game path"

2. Inside the ScummVM file browser, use "Go Up" until you reach the "root" folder where you will see the "<Add a new folder>" option.

3. Choose that, then browse and select the "parent" folder for your games subfolders, e.g. "SD Card > myGames". Click on "Use this folder".

4. Then, a new folder "myGames" will appear on the "root" folder of the ScummVM browser.

5. Browse through this folder to your game data.

Steps 2 and 3 need to be done only once for all of your games.
